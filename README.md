# Skin-Segmentation
Our project aimed to create a robust system that could accurately determine the dominant skin tone of users and provide an accurate assessment of their skin color.

In addition to this, the project focused on recommending appropriate skin tone products based on the identified color. 

To achieve this, we utilized advanced techniques and algorithms such as thresholding and k-means clustering. 

The primary goal of our project was to develop a dependable solution that could help users determine their skin tone and select the best products to optimize their skincare routine.
